# Node, TypeScript & Tests

A small repo with basic tooling to allow someone to write basic typescript functions and unit tests.

One usecase for this repo would be to quickly throw together some code-kata style responses to interview questions. 

## Running the code
All of the solutions are built using TypeScript 3.6, and are tested using [Mocha][mocha] and [Chai][chai], running on Node 12.13.

[mocha]: http://mochajs.org/
[chai]: http://chaijs.com/

To get started, download the repository, and then:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
